# Power BI for Developers: PBIP and CI/CD Unleashed

Join us for a hands-on deep dive into Power BI developer mode and the powerful capabilities unlocked by Power BI Project files (PBIP). In this session, you’ll explore TMDL and PBIR file formats, learning how they open the door to structured, source-controlled development workflows.

We’ll show you how to accelerate your Power BI development using TMDL and PBIR – enhanced with AI-assisted tooling – to boost productivity and consistency.

You’ll also learn how to bring modern DevOps practices into your BI projects, from seamless CI/CD pipelines to automated deployments, using both built-in features and innovative community-driven solutions.

Whether you’re a BI developer or a data professional looking to modernize your workflow, this workshop will equip you with practical techniques to take your Power BI projects within Microsoft Fabric to the next level.

Learn from people who are directly involved in the design of Power BI developer mode and ask your questions.

By the end of this workshop, you will:

– Gain a solid understanding of Power BI Project file formats (PBIP, TMDL, PBIR) and how they support modern, scalable development workflows.

– Learn how to effectively leverage AI to accelerate and enhance Power BI development, with hands-on, practical examples.

– Understand the value of applying DevOps and CI/CD practices to Power BI projects and walk away with actionable solutions—both out-of-the-box and community-driven.
